- 👋 Hi, I’m @unixportadmin22, and I'm designing a computer.

- 👀 As result of this, I’m interested in the Electrical Engineering, Assembly, the C programming language, Retro Technology, and Digital Logic.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning as I go. First version on breadboards, then PCB.

- 💞️ I’m willing to collaborate on anything that will teach me how to do this complicated task.

- 📫 You can find me on GitHub. I have basically no other social media.
