- 👋 Hi, I’m @unixportadmin22, and I'm trying to learn how to code.

- 👀 I’m interested in the Java, Swift, and C programming languages, retro technology, and Sun Microsystems.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning nothing. I have the desire and brain to code, but the syntax and endless libraries of most programming languages I've tried seem to mess me up. Don't really have the best focus or resolve either.

- 💞️ I’m willing to collaborate on anything that will teach me how to do this complicated yet beautiful art. (also basic interpreters)

- 📫 You can find me on GitHub, of course, but I also will have a website soon, and I have a Twitter at @Raccoon_Unix. I'll consider getting other social platforms, but absolutely NO Facebook. I am NOT calling it Meta, no matter how much they try to rebrand.
