- 👋 Hi, I’m @unixportadmin22, and I'm designing a modern 8-bit computer.

- 👀 As result of this, I’m interested in the Electricity, Assembly, and C programming languages, Retro Technology, and Digital Logic.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning as I go. First version on breadboards, then PCB.

- 💞️ I’m willing to collaborate on anything that will teach me how to do this complicated task.

- 📫 You can find me on GitHub, of course, also, follow my project at it's discord server, Sunset City Processing.
